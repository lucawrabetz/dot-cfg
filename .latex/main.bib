	abstract = {Several algorithms already exist for solving the uncapacitated facility location problem. The most efficient are based upon the solution of the strong linear programming relaxation. The dual of this relaxation has a condensed form which consists of minimizing a certain piecewise linear convex function. This paper presents a new method for solving the uncapacitated facility location problem based upon the exact solution of the condensed dual via orthogonal projections. The amount of work per iteration is of the same order as that of a simplex iteration for a linear program inm variables and constraints, wherem is the number of clients. For comparison, the underlying linear programming dual hasmn + m + n variables andmn +n constraints, wheren is the number of potential locations for the facilities. The method is flexible as it can handle side constraints. In particular, when there is a duality gap, the linear programming formulation can be strengthened by adding cuts. Numerical results for some classical test problems are included.},

  title={A survey on mixed-integer programming techniques in bilevel optimization},
  author={Kleinert, Thomas and Labb{\'e}, Martine and Ljubi{\'c}, Ivana and Schmidt, Martin},
  abstract={Bilevel optimization is a field of mathematical programming in which some variables are constrained to be the solution of another optimization problem. As a consequence, bilevel optimization is able to model hierarchical decision processes. This is appealing for modeling real-world problems, but it also makes the resulting optimization models hard to solve in theory and practice. The scientific interest in computational bilevel optimization increased a lot over the last decade and is still growing. Independent of whether the bilevel problem itself contains integer variables or not, many state-of-the-art solution approaches for bilevel optimization make use of techniques that originate from mixed-integer programming. These techniques include branch-and-bound methods, cutting planes and, thus, branch-and-cut approaches, or problem-specific decomposition methods. In this survey article, we review bilevel-tailored approaches that exploit these mixed-integer programming techniques to solve bilevel optimization problems. To this end, we first consider bilevel problems with convex or, in particular, linear lower-level problems. The discussed solution methods in this field stem from original works from the 1980’s but, on the other hand, are still actively researched today. Second, we review modern algorithmic approaches to solve mixed-integer bilevel problems that contain integrality constraints in the lower level. Moreover, we also briefly discuss the area of mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel problems. Third, we devote some attention to more specific fields such as pricing or interdiction models that genuinely contain bilinear and thus nonconvex aspects. Finally, we sketch a list of open questions from the areas of algorithmic and computational bilevel optimization, which may lead to interesting future research that will further propel this fascinating and active field of research.},

% k-optimal follower, a hierarchy of bounds
@article{shi2023koptimal,
	abstract = {We consider mixed integer bilevel linear optimization problems in which the decision variables of the lower-level (follower's) problem are all binary. We propose a general modeling and solution framework motivated by the practical reality that in a Stackelberg game, the follower does not always solve their optimization problem to optimality. They may instead implement a locally optimal solution with respect to a given upper-level decision. Such scenarios may occur when the follower's computational capabilities are limited, or when the follower is not completely rational. Our framework relaxes the typical assumption of perfect rationality that underlies the standard modeling framework by defining a hierarchy of increasingly stringent assumptions about the behavior of the follower. Namely, at level k of this hierarchy, it is assumed that the follower produces a k-optimal solution. Associated with this hierarchy is a hierarchy of upper and lower bounds that are in fact valid for the classical case in which complete rationality of the follower is assumed. Two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations are derived for the resulting optimization problems. Extensive computational results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP formulations and the quality of the bounds produced. The latter are shown to dominate the standard approach based on a single-level relaxation at a reasonable computational cost. Finally, we also explore a class of bilevel problems for which 2-optimal lower-level solutions imply global optimality, and hence we can solve these bilevel problems exactly using the developed MILP formulations.},

On the other hand, the decisions concerning management, control, design and improvement investments are made by the public sector in the interest of the society as a whole. Hence, transportation planning is a characteristic example of a hierarchical process, in which the public sector at one level makes decisions seeking to improve the performance of the network, while at another level the network users make choices with regard to route, travel mode, origin and destination of their travel. Our objective is to provide a review on the current state of research and development in bilevel programming problems that arize in this context, and attract the attention of the global optimization community to this problem class of imense practical importance.},

% benders for binary(linear)-continuous(linear) (upper - lower) bilevel problems for traffic planning
@article{fontaine2014benders,
	abstract = {We propose a new fast solution method for linear Bilevel Problems with binary leader and continuous follower variables under the partial cooperation assumption. We reformulate the Bilevel Problem into a single-level problem by using the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions. This non-linear model can be linearized because of the special structure achieved by the binary leader decision variables and subsequently solved by a Benders Decomposition Algorithm to global optimality. We illustrate the capability of the approach on the Discrete Network Design Problem which adds arcs to an existing road network at the leader stage and anticipates the traffic equilibrium for the follower stage. Because of the non-linear objective functions of this problem, we use a linearization method for increasing, convex and non-linear functions based on continuous variables. Numerical tests show that this algorithm can solve even large instances of Bilevel Problems.},

	Abstract = {We consider combinatorial optimization problems with uncertainty in the cost vector. Recently, a novel approach was developed to deal with such uncertainties: instead of a single one robust solution, obtained by solving a min max problem, the authors consider a set of solutions obtained by solving a min max min problem. In this new approach, the set of solutions is computed once and we can choose the best one in real time each time a cost vector occurs yielding better solutions compared to the min max approach. In this paper, we apply the new approach to the absolute and relative regret cases. Algorithms to solve the min max min robust (relative) regret problems are presented with computational experiments.},

  abstract = {We consider robust combinatorial optimization problems with cost uncertainty where the decision maker can prepare K solutions beforehand and chooses the best of them once the true cost is revealed. Also known as min–max–min robustness (a special case of K-adaptability), it is a viable alternative to otherwise intractable two-stage problems. The uncertainty set assumed in this paper considers that in any scenario, at most Γ of the components of the cost vectors will be higher than expected, which corresponds to the extreme points of the budgeted uncertainty set. While the classical min–max problem with budgeted uncertainty is essentially as easy as the underlying deterministic problem, it turns out that the min–max–min problem is NP-hard for many easy combinatorial optimization problems, and not approximable in general. We thus present an integer programming formulation for solving the problem through a row-and-column generation algorithm. While exact, this algorithm can only cope with small problems, so we present two additional heuristics leveraging the structure of budgeted uncertainty. We compare our row-and-column generation algorithm and our heuristics on min-knapsack and shortest path instances previously used in the scientific literature and find that the heuristics obtain good quality solutions in short computational times.}

When the perturbation has a known (e.g., Toeplitz) structure, the same problem can be solved in polynomial-time using semidefinite programming (SDP).

Assuming the data matrices are rational functions of the perturbation parameters, we show how to formulate sufficient conditions for a robust solution to exist as SDPs. When the perturbation is "full," our conditions are necessary and sufficient. In this case, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee that the robust solution is unique and continuous (Hölder-stable) with respect to the unperturbed problem's data.

We extend the Robust Optimization methodology ([1, 3-6, 9, 13, 14]) to this situation by introducing the Adjustable Robust Counterpart (ARC) associated with an LP of the above structure. Often the ARC is significantly less conservative than the usual Robust Counterpart (RC), however, in most cases the ARC is computationally intractable (NP-hard). This difficulty is addressed by restricting the adjustable variables to be affine functions of the uncertain data. The ensuing Affinely Adjustable Robust Counterpart (AARC) problem is then shown to be, in certain important cases, equivalent to a tractable optimization problem (typically an LP or a Semidefinite problem), and in other cases, having a tight approximation which is tractable. The AARC approach is illustrated by applying it to a multi-stage inventory management problem.},

Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way.

Furthermore, we show that the bound is tight for symmetric uncertainty sets and can be arbitrarily large if the uncertainty set is not symmetric. We refer to the ratio of the optimal cost of the robust problem and the optimal cost of the two-stage stochastic problem as the stochasticity gap. We also extend the bound on the stochasticity gap for another class of uncertainty sets referred to as positive. If both the objective coefficients and right-hand side are uncertain, we show that the stochasticity gap can be arbitrarily large even if the uncertainty set and the probability measure are both symmetric. However, we prove that the adaptability gap (ratio of optimal cost of the robust problem and the optimal cost of a two-stage fully adaptable problem) is at most four even if both the objective coefficients and the right-hand side of the constraints are uncertain and belong to a symmetric uncertainty set. The bound holds for the class of positive uncertainty sets as well.

In particular, we show that the worst-case cost of an optimal affine policy can be $${\Omega(m^{1/2-\delta})}$$times the worst-case cost of an optimal fully-adaptable solution for any δ > 0, where m is the number of linear constraints. We also show that the worst-case cost of the best affine policy is $${O(\sqrt m)}$$times the optimal cost when the first-stage constraint matrix has non-negative coefficients. Moreover, if there are only k ≤ m uncertain parameters, we generalize the performance bound for affine policies to $${O(\sqrt k)}$$, which is particularly useful if only a few parameters are uncertain. We also provide an $${O(\sqrt k)}$$-approximation algorithm for the general case without any restriction on the constraint matrix but the solution is not an affine function of the uncertain parameters. We also give a tight characterization of the conditions under which an affine policy is optimal for the above model. In particular, we show that if the uncertainty set, $${{\mathcal U} \subseteq {\mathbb R}^m_+}$$is a simplex, then an affine policy is optimal. However, an affine policy is suboptimal even if $${{\mathcal U}}$$is a convex combination of only (m + 3) extreme points (only two more extreme points than a simplex) and the worst-case cost of an optimal affine policy can be a factor (2 − δ) worse than the worst-case cost of an optimal fully-adaptable solution for any δ > 0.}

We use this information to construct partitions in the uncertainty set, leading to a finitely adaptable formulation of the problem. We use the same information to determine a lower bound on the fully adaptive solution. The method repeats this process iteratively to further improve the objective until a desired gap is reached. We provide theoretical motivation for this method, and characterize its convergence properties and the growth in the number of partitions. Using these insights, we propose and evaluate enhancements to the method such as warm starts and smarter partition creation. We describe in detail how to apply finite adaptability to multistage AMIO problems to appropriately address nonanticipativity restrictions. Finally, we demonstrate in computational experiments that the method can provide substantial improvements over a nonadaptive solution and existing methods for problems described in the literature. In particular, we find that our method produces high-quality solutions versus the amount of computational effort, even as the problem scales in the number of time stages and the number of decision variables.}

This assumes that the alternative sites have been predetermined and the demand in each customer zone is concentrated at the point representing that region. UFLP focuses on the production and distribution of a single commodity over a single time period (e.g., one year that is representative of the firm's long-run demand and cost structure), during which the demand is assumed to be known with certainty. The distinguishing feature of this basic discrete location problem, however, is the decision maker's ability to determine the size of each facility without any budgetary, technological, or physical restrictions.

	abstract = {Determining the best location to serve companies'profitability and sustainability is becoming more crucial every day, since the rivalry between companies is getting more intense. The transformation of economies from manufacturing orientation towards service based activities has resulted in a growing contribution of the service based economy in gross domestic product and workforce of developing countries. These recent changes in the economy are indicators that service facility related location science has received greater interest. Service location problems has been studied since the 1900s and interest on these types of problems has started to grow especially after the aforementioned economic transformation in the 2000s. A large number of problems have been investigated for different service facilities. However, there is a need for a survey that systematically classifies these papers in order to comprehend them thoroughly due to their prominence and complexity. This paper examines 90 papers that have been published on service facility location problems since 2000. The paper presents a classification based on 19 main characteristics including key features and descriptive dimensions of location problems in order to develop a taxonomy from an operations research perspective to assist the location scientists and practitioners who work on service facility location problems. Furthermore, service facility location problems are categorized according to their application fields and investigated in detail relating to each characteristic. We also draw interesting comparisons of characteristics between facility location problems in different application fields and highlight directions for future research.},

	abstract = { We obtain a 1.5-approximation algorithm for the metric uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which improves on the previously best known 1.52-approximation algorithm by Mahdian, Ye, and Zhang. Note that the approximability lower bound by Guha and Khuller is \$1.463\dots\$. An algorithm is a (\$\lambda\_f\$,\$\lambda\_c\$)-approximation algorithm if the solution it produces has total cost at most \$\lambda\_f\cdot F^*+\lambda\_c\cdot C^*\$, where \$F^*\$ and \$C^*\$ are the facility and the connection cost of an optimal solution. Our new algorithm, which is a modification of the \$(1+2/e)\$-approximation algorithm of Chudak and Shmoys, is a \$(1.6774,1.3738)\$-approximation algorithm for the UFL problem and is the first one that touches the approximability limit curve \$(\gamma\_f,1+2e^{-\gamma\_f})\$ established by Jain, Mahdian, and Saberi. As a consequence, we obtain the first optimal approximation algorithm for instances dominated by connection costs. When combined with a \$(1.11,1.7764)\$-approximation algorithm proposed by Jain et al., and later analyzed by Mahdian et al., we obtain the overall approximation guarantee of 1.5 for the metric UFL problem. We also describe how to use our algorithm to improve the approximation ratio for the 3-level version of UFL. },

  abstract = {Dependent rounding is a useful technique for optimization problems with hard budget constraints. This framework naturally leads to negative correlation properties. However, what if an application naturally calls for dependent rounding on the one hand and desires positive correlation on the other? More generally, we develop algorithms that guarantee the known properties of dependent rounding but also have nearly bestpossible behavior—near-independence, which generalizes positive correlation—on “small” subsets of the variables. The recent breakthrough of Li and Svensson for the classical k-median problem has to handle positive correlation in certain dependent rounding settings, and does so implicitly. We improve upon Li-Svensson’s approximation ratio for k-median from 2.732 + ϵ to 2.675 + ϵ by developing an algorithm that improves upon various aspects of their work. Our dependent rounding approach helps us improve the dependence of the runtime on the parameter ϵ from Li-Svensson’s NO(1/ϵ2) to NO((1/ϵ)log(1/ϵ)).},

@article{guha1999greedy,
	abstract = {A fundamental facility location problem is to choose the location of facilities, such as industrial plants and warehouses, to minimize the cost of satisfying the demand for some commodity. There are associated costs for locating the facilities, as well as transportation costs for distributing the commodities. We assume that the transportation costs form a metric. This problem is commonly referred to as theuncapacitated facility locationproblem. Application to bank account location and clustering, as well as many related pieces of work, are discussed by Cornuejols, Nemhauser, and Wolsey. Recently, the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem was obtained by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal. We show that a simple greedy heuristic combined with the algorithm by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal, can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee of 2.408. We discuss a few variants of the problem, demonstrating better approximation factors for restricted versions of the problem. We also show that the problem is max SNP-hard. However, the inapproximability constants derived from the max SNP hardness are very close to one. By relating this problem to Set Cover, we prove a lower bound of 1.463 on the best possible approximation ratio, assumingNP∉DTIME[nO(loglogn)].},

  abstract = {In the online and incremental variants of Facility Location, the demands arrive one-by-one and must be assigned to an open facility upon arrival, without any knowledge about future demands. In the online variant, the decisions of opening a facility at a particular location and of assigning a demand to some facility are irrevocable. In the incremental variant, the algorithm can also merge existing facilities (and the corresponding demand clusters) with each other, and only the decision of assigning some demands to the same facility is irrevocable. The goal is to maintain, either online or incrementally, a set of facilities and an assignment of the demands to them that minimize the total facility opening cost plus the assignment cost for all demands.In this survey, we discuss the previous work on online and incremental algorithms for Facility Location. In addition to the main results, namely that the competitive ratio for the online variant is Θ(log nlog log n), where n is the number of demands, and that the competitive ratio for the incremental variant is O(1), we discuss all known online and incremental Facility Location algorithms, sketch the intuition behind them and the main ideas of their competitive analysis, and discuss some applications.},

  abstractNote = {NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility mades NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for eash exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdoes-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models, are included. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},
